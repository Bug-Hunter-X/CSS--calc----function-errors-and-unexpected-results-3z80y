The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected results or errors if the syntax is not used correctly. For example, mixing units without proper conversion, or forgetting the required spaces around operators. Another issue is the incompatibility of `calc()` with older browsers, although it is widely supported nowadays.
